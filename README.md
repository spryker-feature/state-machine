# Spryker Feature: State Machine

State Machine allows you to define, execute and visualize predefined and automated processes. It can model events that involve performing a predetermined sequence of actions, for example in the order process, e.g. order is being shipped if the payment is successful. You can tailor the State Machine to your needs to trigger certain processes automatically or execute them manually.
